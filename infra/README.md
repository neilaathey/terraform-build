Getting to know GCP Cloud Build and Terraform ###########################


NOTE: Windows Credential mamager was storing work user name and trying to git push with those credentials (and failing) - found this:

Start --> Control Panel ---> User Accounts ---> Manager your credentials ---> Windows Credentials

Then search for an entry like, git:https://github.com and remove it. It works fine after that.
